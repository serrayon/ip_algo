Algorithm for file updates in Python

Project description
We validate network access by ensuring that only approved IP addresses are permitted. The process begins with importing a file and accessing its data. Subsequently, we convert the data into a list, facilitating efficient filtering. Unapproved IP addresses are then removed from the list. Finally, we revert the data to its original form, completing the verification of the updated list.

Open the file that contains the allow list:

# Build `with` statement to read in the initial contents of the file

  with open(import_file, "r") as file:

Read the file contents:

# Use `.read()` to read the imported file and store it in a variable named `ip_addresses`

    ip_addresses = file.read()

Convert the string into a list:

# Use `.split()` to convert `ip_addresses` from a string to a list

  ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

Iterate through the remove list:

  # Build iterative statement
  # Name loop variable `element`
  
  # Loop through `ip_addresses`

  for element in ip_addresses:
    

Remove IP addresses that are on the remove list:

# then current element should be removed from `ip_addresses`

      ip_addresses.remove(element)


Update the file with the revised list of IP addresses:

 # Convert `ip_addresses` back to a string so that it can be written into the text file     

  ip_addresses = " ".join(ip_addresses)

  # Build `with` statement to rewrite the original file

  with open(import_file, "w") as file:

    # Rewrite the file, replacing its contents with `ip_addresses`

    file.write(ip_addresses)

Summary
You can run the program by going into the directory and in the terminal type: python3 algo.py
